To meet the requirements of assignment 2, I made some adjustments to my assignment 1 file. Here are some of them:
1. I'm utilising a database to store the product info rather than a json file.
2. I'm using SQL queries to get the data from the database.
3. The dynamic categories tab was made so that anytime a user added a new item with a new category type, it would automatically appear on the website.
4. No matter how many items we have, only 7 data will be displayed on a single page thanks to the creation of dynamic next and previous buttons utilising SQL queries and php code.
5. To prevent page reloading with each click of the add to cart and remove buttons, javascript and Ajax are used.
6. Values for the Add to Cart button will be added to the session table and utilised to display the cart using ajax.
